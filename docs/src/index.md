# Simple documentation generator
This module provides a simple tool to generate documentation for your project.
This documentation is self-generated and therefore servers as an example of its output with the default theme.


## Quickstart
The following parses everything inside of `docs` and outputs it to `docs/out`.
Project name, description and author are read from your `package.json` file.

```bash
docs -i docs -o docs/out
```
